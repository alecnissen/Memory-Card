<h1>About This Project</h1> 
I wanted to make this a portfolio piece because it highlights my ability to use REST API's to retrieve and use data from an external server. It also showcases my skills and experience using React components, responsive UI design, state management, and short circuit conditionals to render data. In this project I used Axios to make API calls. I also wrote conditions to handle errors and loading screens within the API call conditions
